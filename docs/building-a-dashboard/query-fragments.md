# Query Fragments

The `QueryFragments` class serves as the **Geographic Routing Engine** for your data source. While the `BreakoutQueryBuilder` provides the structural "skeleton" of the SQL query, the `QueryFragments` class provides the "spatial intelligence" required to drill down into specific administrative levels.

## Core Functionality

This class translates a hierarchical `filterPath` (when using the Area Filter tool) into specific SQL `SELECT` and `WHERE` clauses. It ensures that as a user navigates deeper into the geographic tree, the query automatically shifts its focus to the next logical administrative level.

## Key Features and Advantages

### 1. Dynamic Drill-Down Logic

The class uses a "top-down" conditional structure. It detects the lowest level currently selected in the filter and automatically sets the **next level down** as the `area_code`. For example, if you are looking at a **County**, the class sets the `area_code` to be **Subcounty**. This enables "drill-down" reporting where clicking on a region automatically fetches its children without the developer writing separate queries for every level.

### 2. Data Normalization via `LPAD`

CSPro data often stores geographic codes as integers, which can lose leading zeros (e.g., `1` instead of `01`). The `LPAD(column, length, '0')` function ensures codes are treated as standardized strings, preventing join failures when comparing database integers against standardized geographic codes from your `Areas` table.

### 3. Context-Aware Filtering

The class maintains the "parental context" in the `WHERE` clause. For example, if filtering by a specific **Subcounty**, the generated query does not just filter by `subcounty_code` — it includes the IDs for the `County` as well. This ensures data integrity, especially in cases where code IDs might repeat across different parent areas.

## How It Plugs into the Query Builder

This class acts as a "plugin" for the `BreakoutQueryBuilder`. When the builder is initialized:

1. It calls `getSqlFragments($filterPath)`.
2. The `QueryFragments` class returns an array containing the `area_code` definition and the matching geographic conditions.
3. The Builder merges these into its `$columns` and `$conditions` arrays, which are later turned into the `SELECT` and `WHERE` clauses of the query.

## Logic Walkthrough

| If the Filter Path is... | The `selectColumns` becomes... | The `whereConditions` filters by... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Empty** (National Level) | `county` (The top-level units) | Nothing (returns all counties) |
| **County "01"** | `subcounty` | `county = '01'` |
| **Sublocation "10"** | `ea` (Enumeration Area) | `county`, `subcounty`, `division`, `location`, `sublocation` |

## Advantages for the Developer

- **Single Source of Truth:** The mapping between database columns (like `division`) and their administrative meaning is defined in one place.
- **Abstraction of Complexity:** You simply pass a `$filterPath` string; you do not need to manually calculate which levels are parents or children.
- **Scalability:** If the administrative structure changes (e.g., adding a "Ward" level), you only need to update this fragment class rather than every individual indicator in the dashboard.

In short, this class is the **bridge** that tells the Query Builder exactly "where" in the country the data should be pulled from based on the user's current view.

## In the Sandbox

When you created your data source, a `QueryFragments` class was automatically generated for you. It is located in the `app/Services/QueryFragments/` directory and is named `KenyaCensusQueryFragments.php`.

The generated class ships with the `$levels` array **commented out** as a template — you must uncomment it and customize the column names and padding lengths to match your database schema. You can also regenerate the class at any time with `php artisan chimera:make-queryfragment`.

Based on the schema of the Kenya Census database, here is what your `QueryFragments` class should look like after customization:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Services\QueryFragments;

use Uneca\Chimera\Services\AreaTree;

class KenyaCensusQueryFragments
{
    protected array $levels = [
        'County'      => "LPAD(county, 2, '0')",
        'Subcounty'   => "LPAD(subcounty, 2, '0')",
        'Division'    => "LPAD(division, 2, '0')",
        'Location'    => "LPAD(location, 2, '0')",
        'Sublocation' => "LPAD(sublocation, 2, '0')",
        'EA'          => "LPAD(ea, 3, '0')",
    ];

    public function getSqlFragments(string $filterPath) : array
    {
        $filter = AreaTree::pathAsFilter($filterPath);
        $hierarchy = array_keys($this->levels);

        // Assume filter is empty (Select the highest level, no conditions)
        $selectColumns = [current($this->levels) . " AS area_code"];
        $fromTables = [];
        $whereConditions = [];

        for ($i = 0; $i < count($hierarchy); $i++) {
            $currentLevel = $hierarchy[$i];
            $nextLevel = $hierarchy[$i + 1] ?? null;

            // If the filter for this level is blank, stop accumulating
            if (blank($filter[$currentLevel] ?? null)) {
                break;
            }

            if ($nextLevel) {
                $selectColumns = ["{$this->levels[$nextLevel]} AS area_code"];
            }
            $whereConditions[] = "{$this->levels[$currentLevel]} = '{$filter[$currentLevel]}'";
        }

        return [$selectColumns, $whereConditions, $fromTables];
    }
}
```

### Understanding the Code

- **`$levels` array** — Maps each administrative level name to its corresponding SQL expression. The array keys (e.g., `'County'`, `'Subcounty'`) **must match the area hierarchy level names** you created earlier; otherwise the filter detection in the loop will not match. The `LPAD` function ensures codes are zero-padded to the correct length (2 digits for County through Sublocation, 3 digits for EA).
- **`getSqlFragments()` method** — Takes the current filter path and returns three arrays: `$selectColumns` (which column to select as the area code), `$whereConditions` (which conditions to filter by), and `$fromTables` (additional tables to join; always empty in this implementation).
- The loop iterates through the hierarchy levels, accumulating `WHERE` conditions for each level that has a filter value, and selecting the next level down as the `area_code`.
